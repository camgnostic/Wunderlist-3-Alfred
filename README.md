# Wunderlist-3-Alfred #
A Wunderlist 3 API friendly Alfred 2 workflow

I noticed that many people were frustrated by Yosemite and Wunderlist 3 removing the easy System Events / Accessibility access to Wunderlist from the Alfred search bar.  I poked around with Wunderlist's API and put together a python script that adds a lot of Wunderlist to-do list functionality to Alfred.  Relied heavily on [Workflow.py](http://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/) and similarly am licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial](cc) license [License.txt](License.txt)

## Documentation ##
Install the workflow into Alfred 2.  Default keyword is "wl".  All commands are displayed in place.  The source code is all here, but the full version can be downloaded [here](Wunderlist3.alfredworkflow).
